Project Status: Prototype Development (Core Components Implemented)
Technology Stack: Ethereum | Solidity | React | Web3.js

Project Overview
This prototype demonstrates a decentralized insurance claims processing system built on Ethereum blockchain technology. The solution aims to automate claims adjudication while providing transparent audit trails and reducing administrative overhead.

Technical Implementation
Smart Contract Features
Policy lifecycle management (creation/termination)

Claims submission with cryptographic proof

Multi-stage claim adjudication (Pending → Approved → Paid)

Automated payout calculations

Event logging for all transactions

Frontend Components
Wallet connection interface

Policy dashboard

Claims submission form

Admin review panel

Transaction history viewer

Development Progress
Completed:
✓ Smart contract development (90%)
✓ Core business logic implementation
✓ Unit testing framework
✓ Basic React frontend scaffolding

In Progress:
◻ Frontend-contract integration
◻ Comprehensive test coverage
◻ Gas optimization
◻ Production deployment pipeline
