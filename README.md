# Blockchain Insurance Claims Prototype

*A proof-of-concept for decentralized insurance claims processing*



## Overview
Developed a prototype for a blockchain-based insurance claims system to demonstrate:
- Smart contract automation of claims processing
- Transparent audit trails on Ethereum blockchain
- Decentralized dispute resolution architecture

**Status**: Development paused (Core smart contracts completed, frontend integration in progress)

## Technical Stack
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (Solidity)
- **Frontend**: React.js + Ethers.js
- **Tools**: Truffle, Ganache, MetaMask
- **Features**:
  - Policy creation via smart contracts
  - Claim submission with cryptographic proof
  - Automated payout logic

## Key Contributions
- Designed smart contract architecture
- Implemented claim lifecycle state machine
- Built React frontend with wallet integration
- Documented system design decisions

## Lessons Learned
✔ Blockchain's potential for insurance transparency  
✔ Challenges of wallet integration  
✔ Importance of comprehensive testing  
✔ Gas optimization techniques
